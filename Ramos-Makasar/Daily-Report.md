Current Task:
Review project documents and repository melkiandy/project-saas, then prepare BAN for Option A and a 24-week Phase 1 implementation timeline.

Status:
Done

Progress:
100%

Completed:
- Reviewed Application Blueprint, Commercial Proposal, Scope of Work Phase 1, and Recommended Commercial Proposal Strategy.
- Confirmed documented direction: Phase 1 Option A, 6 months/24 weeks, with recommended investment range Rp158,000,000-Rp162,000,000 before PPN.
- Reviewed the current .NET 8 solution structure and mapped existing foundations versus new Phase 1 modules.
- Created docs/project-makasar/BAN-Option-A-Phase-1.md.
- Created docs/project-makasar/Timeline-Phase-1-Option-A.md.
- Documented included scope, deferred scope, repository mapping, milestones, risks, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and critical path.

Issue / Blocker:
- No technical blocker.
- Final contract value, kickoff date, legal contracting entity, signatories, and detailed business configuration are not yet documented.

Need Decision:
- Confirm final Option A value within Rp158,000,000-Rp162,000,000.
- Confirm kickoff and target go-live dates.
- Confirm legal client entity and authorized signatories.
- Confirm organization/tenant/branch structure, permission matrix, basic approval scenarios, master-data priority, and push notification provider.

Risk:
- The 24-week target may shift if multi-level approval or other deferred enterprise complexity is added without scope trade-off/change request.
- UAT may be delayed if business decisions, initial master data, infrastructure, or key-user availability are late.

Next Action:
- Review the BAN draft with Pak Hadi and relevant stakeholders.
- Close the outstanding decisions and convert the relative 24-week baseline into calendar dates.
- Approve the Phase 1 backlog and acceptance criteria before kickoff.

Current Task:
Convert the BAN Option A Phase 1 and Phase 1 timeline documents from Markdown into Microsoft Word format for stakeholder discussion.

Status:
Done

Progress:
100%

Completed:
- Created docs/project-makasar/BAN-Option-A-Phase-1.docx.
- Created docs/project-makasar/Timeline-Phase-1-Option-A.docx.
- Preserved headings, lists, and tables from the Markdown source.
- Reopened and validated both DOCX files using Microsoft Word.
- Verified BAN output: 6 pages and 3 tables.
- Verified timeline output: 5 pages and 4 tables.

Issue / Blocker:
- No blocker.

Need Decision:
- Stakeholder review is required for the BAN confirmation points and timeline baseline.

Risk:
- Content remains a discussion draft until commercial value, kickoff date, signatories, and business configuration are confirmed.

Next Action:
- Discuss both Word documents with Pak Hadi and stakeholders.
- Record agreed revisions and finalize the BAN and calendar-based timeline.

Current Task:
Configure VS Code debugging for local Development execution of Account API, Notification API, and Web Admin while PostgreSQL and Redis run in Docker.

Status:
Done

Progress:
100%

Completed:
- Reviewed the solution, project launch profiles, application settings, dependency configuration, Docker ports, and output assemblies.
- Updated local .vscode/launch.json with individual Account API, Notification API, and Web Admin configurations.
- Added compound configurations for Full Solution and Backend APIs.
- Added .vscode/tasks.json for solution build and optional PostgreSQL/Redis Docker start/stop tasks.
- Configured Account API on localhost:9010, Notification API on localhost:9020, and Web Admin on localhost:9080.
- Configured Development environment, PostgreSQL localhost:5433, Redis localhost:6379, and local API endpoint overrides.
- Verified VS Code JSON syntax.
- Verified dotnet build: succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Verified PostgreSQL and Redis Docker containers are running and healthy/available.
- Smoke-tested all three applications; Account API, Notification API, and Web Admin returned HTTP 200.

Issue / Blocker:
- No runtime blocker.
- The repository .gitignore excludes the .vscode directory, so launch.json and tasks.json are local-only unless repository tracking policy is changed.

Need Decision:
- Decide whether shared VS Code configuration should be committed by adding an explicit .gitignore exception for selected .vscode files.

Risk:
- Other developers will not receive the VS Code debug configuration through Git while .vscode remains ignored.

Next Action:
- Use the "Development: Full Solution" compound in VS Code after PostgreSQL and Redis are running.
- Confirm whether launch.json and tasks.json should become shared repository configuration.

Current Task:
Update the Phase 1 Option A timeline with implementation status tracking and publish updated Markdown and Word versions to the Project SaaS directory.

Status:
Done

Progress:
100%

Completed:
- Restored Timeline-Phase-1-Option-A.md because the Markdown source was no longer present in the filesystem or Git history.
- Added overall status, implementation progress, last-updated date, and a status summary dashboard.
- Added status and progress columns to all 24-week workstreams.
- Added status definitions, solution readiness, commercial milestone status, risk status, and weekly status-update rules.
- Set current implementation status to Planning / Pre-Kickoff with 0% implementation progress.
- Published D:\Project Reference\Project SaaS\Timeline-Phase-1-Option-A.md.
- Published D:\Project Reference\Project SaaS\Timeline-Phase-1-Option-A.docx.
- Validated the Word document: 6 pages, 6 tables, and status indicators present.

Issue / Blocker:
- No technical blocker.
- Official kickoff date and baseline approval are not yet confirmed.

Need Decision:
- Confirm kickoff date, final scope baseline, acceptance criteria, and workstream weighting before implementation progress is calculated.

Risk:
- Reporting implementation progress before official kickoff could misrepresent project delivery; current progress remains 0%.

Next Action:
- Review and approve the status-enabled timeline with Pak Hadi and stakeholders.
- Convert relative project weeks into calendar dates after kickoff confirmation.
- Begin weekly status updates once the project is officially initiated.
